📌 Project: SMS Spam Classifier

This is my first Machine Learning project while learning ML.
The project classifies SMS text messages as either Spam or Not Spam using Natural Language Processing and Naive Bayes classifiers.

🎯 Objective

To understand and practice:

Text preprocessing

TF-IDF vectorization

Classical Machine Learning models

Model evaluation and comparison

🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-Learn

Seaborn

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset

Dataset contains SMS text messages labeled as ham (not spam) or spam.

(ham was converted to 0 and spam to 1 during preprocessing)

🧪 Workflow

✔ Clean & preprocess dataset
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis
✔ Feature extraction with TF-IDF
✔ Train-test split
✔ Models trained:

Gaussian Naive Bayes

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Bernoulli Naive Bayes
✔ Evaluate and compare model performance

📊 Model Results (Summary)

Models compared using metrics such as:

Accuracy

Precision

Confusion Matrix

MultinomialNB generally performs best for text classification tasks.

🧠 Key Learnings

Through this project I learned:

Basics of NLP & text preprocessing

Converting text into vectors for ML models

How Naive Bayes works for text classification

Comparing different ML models

Handling class imbalance & evaluation metrics
